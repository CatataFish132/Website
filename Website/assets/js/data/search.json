If you have, you might also know how to solve these set’s of equations. We won’t go into that right now but if you ever see a set of equations in this form you can use linear algebra!\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\alpha_1x_1 + \\alpha_2x_2 + \\alpha_3x_3 &amp;=&amp; b_1 \\\\\\alpha_4x_1 + \\alpha_5x_2 + \\alpha_6x_3 &amp;=&amp; b_2 \\\\\\alpha_7x_1 + \\alpha_8x_2 + \\alpha_9x_3 &amp;=&amp; b_3 \\\\\\text{(1.2)}\\end{array}\\]We can rewrite this set of equation with matrices (don’t worry if you don’t understand how it works yet because we will get into that later.)\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha_1 &amp; \\alpha_2 &amp; \\alpha_3 \\\\\\alpha_4 &amp; \\alpha_5 &amp; \\alpha_6 \\\\\\alpha_7 &amp; \\alpha_8 &amp; \\alpha_9\\end{pmatrix}, \\quadx = \\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\\\x_2 \\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix}, \\quadb = \\begin{pmatrix}b_1 \\\\b_2 \\\\b_3\\end{pmatrix} \\\\text{ (1.3)}\\]If we then write $Ax = b$ we will have the exact same of set of equations also called a linear system as we had in 1.2. Here A is a matrix and, x is a vector just like b. In the next section we will explore how multiplication with matrices and vectors works so you can also see why Ax=b is the same as the linear system we had before." } ]
